# 🏃 Player Performance Biomechanics

## 📌 Overview

Player Performance Biomechanics is an AI-powered system designed to analyze athletes’ movements and evaluate their biomechanical efficiency using computer vision techniques. The project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from video data to help improve athletic performance, optimize training strategies, and reduce the risk of injuries.

By leveraging pose estimation, the system tracks body keypoints, computes joint angles, and studies motion patterns to identify inefficiencies in posture and movement. The generated feedback enables a data-driven approach to performance enhancement that can benefit athletes, coaches, and sports analysts.
